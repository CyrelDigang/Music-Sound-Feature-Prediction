# Music Sound Feature Prediction

This project explores the prediction and visualization of music sound features using a dataset sourced from **Spotify**. It applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify patterns in audio characteristics such as tempo, energy, danceability, and more.

## üìå Project Overview

Using the Spotify dataset (`data.csv`), this project demonstrates how to:
- Load and preprocess music feature data
- Analyze relationships between audio features
- Visualize feature distributions and correlations
- Apply predictive models to gain insights into musical trends

The notebook is optimized for execution in **Google Colab**, leveraging Google Drive for seamless data access.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Instructions to Run the Code

1. **Open in Google Colab**  
   Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to open the provided `SoundPrediction.ipynb` notebook.

2. **Upload Dataset to Google Drive**  
   Upload the `data.csv` file to your Google Drive.

3. **Connect Google Drive to Colab**  
   In the notebook, run the following code to mount Google Drive:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
4. **Update Dataset Path**
   Replace the placeholder path in the notebook with the actual path to your `data.csv`
